# Further Exploration

This is just the beginning of interesting things we can do to help us visualize the Lightning Network. Hopefully this tutorial provided you with an overview of how we can interface with a Lightning Network node to retrieve information and receive real time updates.

A few ideas for how you can continue your exploration:

- How would you add other information to our user interface? What part of the application needs to be changed?
- How would you connect to c-lightning or Eclair? What would need to change about the architecture?
- How would you connect to testnet or mainnet? How would you address scaling given that the main network has 10's of thousands of nodes and channels?
- How would you make our application production ready? How would you add testing? What happens if LND restarts? What happens if the REST/WebSocket server restarts?
