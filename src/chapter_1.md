# Visualzing the Lightning Graph

This application will use Node.js with Typescript, Express, and D3.js to create a visualization of the Lightning Network graph.

## Development Environment

A development environment for the Lightning network typeically consists of a Bitcoin node running in simnet mode and one or more Lightning Network nodes. Getting all this running can be time consuming. Fortunately, there is the tool [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com) that allows us to spin up Lightning network testing environments easily!

Our first step is to download and install Polar for your operating system from the [website](https://lightningpolar.com).

For a Linux system, it will be as an AppImage. You will need to grant executable rights to the file, then you can run the application.

Once Polar is running, you can create a new network. Polar allows us to run many different networks with varying configurations. For this application we will start the network with 1 LND node, 1 c-lightning node, 1 Eclair, and 1 Bitcoin Core node. Provide a name for this network.

Start the network once it has been created. Polar will launch Docker containers for each of the nodes in your network.

Polar also provides a few tools to allow us to easily perform common tasks.

We will start by depositing some funds into Alice's node. To do this, click on Alice's node, then click on the `Actions` tab.

We will then deposit 1,000,000 satoshis into Alice's node. When you click the `Deposit` button, the Bitcoin Core node running in simnet will create new blocks to an address and 0.01000000 bitcoin (1,000,000 satoshis) will deposited into an address controlled by Alice's Lightning Network node.

Now that Alice has some funds, she can create a channel with another node on the network. We can do this by opening an outgoing channel by clicking the `Outgoing` button in the `Open Channel` section of Alice's Actions tab.

Let's choose Bob as the channel counterparty and fund the channel with 250,000 satoshis.

We should now see a channel link between Alice and Bob in our channel graph.

At this point, we are ready to connect to Alice's node via the API.

### Connecting to Alice's node

## Understanding the Lightning Graph

## LND Connectivity

For this project, since we'll only be retreiving data we're going to use the LND REST API. The LND REST API provides swagger files, so we could use these to generate TypeScript references and a client. Because we're using a small subset of API's we'll create a simple client on our our own to retrieve the results

LND also has a gRPC API that can be used for streaming information about your node
